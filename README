NAME
    CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Locator::Grid - A CGI::Wiki plugin to manage
    co-ordinate data.

DESCRIPTION
    Access to and calculations using co-ordinate metadata supplied to a
    CGI::Wiki wiki when writing a node.

    Note: This is *read-only* access. If you want to write to a node's
    metadata, you need to do it using the "write_node" method of CGI::Wiki.

    We assume that the points are located on a flat, square grid with unit
    squares of side 1 metre.
